/**
 * Cloudflare Workers AI (OpenAI-compatible) adapter.
 *
 * Cloudflare exposes an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint under
 * each account at
 * `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1`, so
 * there are two env-var dependencies rather than the usual one:
 *
 *   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is embedded in the base URL path.
 *   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` is the bearer token (comma-separated for
 *     rotation, same shape as every other provider).
 *
 * Two design choices worth flagging:
 *
 * 1. `baseUrl` is a getter, not a static string. It reads
 *    `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` every time so test env overrides and
 *    runtime config changes take effect without re-instantiating the
 *    provider. This matches the Ollama pattern where the base URL is
 *    env-driven.
 *
 * 2. `getApiKeys()` returns `[]` when EITHER env var is unset, regardless
 *    of the other. If we only checked `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, a configured
 *    key plus a missing account id would produce a request against a URL
 *    with an empty account segment ("/accounts//ai/v1/chat/completions"),
 *    which is both wasteful and leaks the key to an unrelated path.
 *    Requiring both variables together keeps `isEnabled()` honest.
 *
 * Model ids are carried through verbatim. The base `mapRequest` strips
 * the `cloudflare/` prefix, leaving `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-...` as the
 * model id Cloudflare expects. No override is needed.
